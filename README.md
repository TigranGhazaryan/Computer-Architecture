# Computer-Architecture

This is a personal project, using Logisim Evolution. Building basic logic gates, simple SR-Latches, 4-bit Adders, 1-bit Register, RAM, etc. 
The idea is to learn how the fundamental structures work and experiment on them. 

Inspiration comes from Charles Petzold's book "Code" (a must read for anyone interested in fundamentals of computer architecture, and their history)
